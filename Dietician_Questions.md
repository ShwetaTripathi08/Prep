**Event-Driven Architectures**:

---

### **1. Simple Definition**
> "Event-driven architecture is a way of building systems where actions are triggered by events. For example, in the Dietician Web Application, when patient data is updated, it triggers processes like validating the diet plan and notifying a dietician dashboard."

---

### **2. How It Worked in the Dietician Web App**
> "In the Dietician Web Application, events like updating patient health information or importing data from Excel would trigger backend processes. These included updating meal plans in real-time or sending updates to other parts of the application through APIs."

---

### **3. Your Role**
- **Monitoring Events:**
  > "I made sure events were being processed correctly by monitoring logs in AWS CloudWatch and Splunk. If an event failed, like a patient update not triggering a new meal plan, I investigated and helped fix the issue."

- **Debugging Issues:**
  > "Sometimes, events didn’t process because of missing data or other errors. I checked logs to find out why and worked with the team to fix the automation scripts."

---

### **4. Example of Your Contribution**
> "Once, a patient data import was failing to trigger updates for meal plans. I found that some of the imported files had formatting issues. I updated the validation logic, so the system could handle these cases, and all events were processed correctly after that."

---

### **5. Tools You Used**
> "I worked with AWS tools like CloudWatch and Splunk to track events and troubleshoot issues. I also helped optimize automation scripts written in Python to make the system process events more smoothly."

---

### **6. Benefits of Event-Driven Systems**
> "It’s great for real-time systems like the Dietician Web App because it makes sure updates happen quickly and reliably. It also helps different parts of the application work independently, so if one part has an issue, the rest can keep running."

---

### **7. Connect It to the Job**
> "My experience with handling events in the Dietician Web Application, including monitoring, debugging, and optimizing event-driven workflows, has given me a strong foundation for working on similar systems. I’m comfortable troubleshooting and ensuring smooth event processing."
