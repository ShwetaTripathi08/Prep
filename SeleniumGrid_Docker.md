4. Monitor and Optimize in CloudWatch
**Create CloudWatch Metrics**:

**Use custom metrics to monitor key parameters**, such as:
Test execution time.
Number of passed/failed tests.
Set Alarms:

**Configure alarms to notify you of issues** (e.g., test failures or grid downtime).
Example: **Create an alarm **for high failure rates.
Create Dashboards:

**Visualize metrics** like test execution time, pass/fail counts, and Selenium Grid node usage in a CloudWatch dashboard.



Query Logs:

Use **CloudWatch Logs Insights** to analyze logs for performance trends, errors, and failures.
Example query:
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /FAIL/
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 20
