### **2. Application Architecture Overview**  

The Dietician Web Application is built on a scalable, cloud-based architecture that integrates several key components:  

#### **Frontend:**  
- **Technology:** Angular  
- **Deployment:** Hosted on AWS (e.g., Amplify or S3 with CloudFront)  
- **Purpose:** Provides a dynamic, user-friendly interface for healthcare providers to input patient data, view personalized diet plans, and access analytics.  

#### **Backend:**  
- **Technology:** Postgres RDS (Relational Database Service)  
- **Purpose:** Stores patient data, dietary information, and system configurations in a secure and scalable database.  

#### **APIs:**  
- **Technology:** REST APIs managed through AWS API Gateway  
- **Purpose:** Handles data exchange between the frontend and backend, ensuring secure and efficient communication.  

#### **Automation and Backend Logic:**  
- **Technology:** Rest Assured ,Postman
- **Purpose:** Used for automation tasks such as data transformation, API testing, and backend processing.  

#### **Logging and Monitoring:**  
1. **AWS CloudWatch:**  
   - Tracks performance metrics, logs API requests/responses, and monitors application health.  
2. **Splunk:**  
   - Aggregates logs from various components for centralized analysis and troubleshooting.

### **3. Common Issues and Troubleshooting Scenarios**  

#### **Frontend (Angular) Issues:**  
1. **UI Not Loading or Errors Displayed:**  
   - **Possible Cause:** API Gateway is down or misconfigured.  
   - **Troubleshooting Steps:**  
     - Check the browser console for network errors (e.g., 404, 500).  
     - Ensure API Gateway is reachable by testing endpoints using Postman or cURL.  
     - Verify deployment status in AWS (Amplify or S3/CloudFront).  

2. **Build or Deployment Failures:**  
   - **Possible Cause:** Misconfigured build pipeline or missing environment variables.  
   - **Troubleshooting Steps:**  
     - Review build logs in the CI/CD tool (e.g., AWS CodePipeline).  
     - Ensure all environment variables (e.g., API endpoints, keys) are correctly set.  

---

#### **Backend (Postgres RDS) Issues:**  
1. **Database Connection Errors:**  
   - **Possible Cause:** Incorrect connection string or RDS instance downtime.  
   - **Troubleshooting Steps:**  
     - Check RDS instance status in AWS Console.  
     - Verify security group settings to ensure the API can access the database.  

2. **Slow Query Performance:**  
   - **Possible Cause:** Inefficient queries or high load on the database.  
   - **Troubleshooting Steps:**  
     - Use CloudWatch to monitor RDS performance (CPU, memory, IOPS).  
     - Identify slow queries using the RDS Performance Insights tool and optimize indexes.  

---

#### **API Gateway & REST API Issues:**  
1. **500 Internal Server Errors:**  
   - **Possible Cause:** Backend service error or unhandled exception.  
   - **Troubleshooting Steps:**  
     - Check CloudWatch logs for error details.  
     - Ensure API deployment is up to date and configuration is correct.  

2. **Invalid Query Parameters:**  
   - **Possible Cause:** Incorrect payload structure or missing parameters.  
   - **Troubleshooting Steps:**  
     - Validate query parameters and payloads against API documentation.  
     - Manually test the API using tools like Postman to identify issues.  

---

### **4. Monitoring and Logging Best Practices**  

#### **CloudWatch Monitoring:**  
- **Key Metrics to Monitor:**  
  - API latency and error rates  
  - RDS CPU usage, memory, and connection counts  
  - Lambda execution duration (if used)  

- **Alarms:**  
  - Set up alarms for high error rates, API timeouts, or RDS resource thresholds.  

#### **Splunk Logging:**  
- Ensure all API requests/responses and application errors are logged to Splunk for analysis.  
- Use predefined Splunk dashboards to monitor application health and detect anomalies.

### **5. Incident Management and Escalation**  

1. **Incident Handling Process:**  
   - Identify and categorize the issue (frontend, backend, API, etc.).  
   - Follow the relevant troubleshooting steps outlined in this guide.  
   - Document the incident in the issue tracker (e.g., JIRA or ServiceNow).  

2. **Escalation Path:**  
   - Level 1 Support → Level 2 Support → DevOps Team → Development Team  
   - Ensure timely escalation for critical incidents impacting availability or data integrity.  

---

### **6. Backup and Recovery**  

- **Database Backups:**  
  - Ensure automated daily backups of Postgres RDS are enabled.  
  - Test recovery procedures periodically to ensure data restoration processes work correctly.  

- **API and Frontend Rollback:**  
  - Maintain previous deployment versions to facilitate quick rollback in case of deployment issues.
