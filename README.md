Monitoring and Maintenance: Actively monitor applications and interfaces, noting performance trends, and taking corrective actions to improve performance and prevent issues.1
Issue Resolution: Respond to identified problems, complete analysis, diagnose root causes, and implement solutions to resolve issues. This includes resolving data-related issues and managing configuration changes within the front-end of applications.1
User Support: Train, mentor, and assist business users in the use of applications, answering "How do I?" questions, and ensuring user support is transitioned effectively.1

Monitoring Tools: Tools like Nagios, Splunk, or New Relic for monitoring application performance and identifying issues proactively.
