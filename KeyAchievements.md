**
Debugged and optimized API integrations across multiple platforms, ensuring seamless data flow and
minimal downtime.**

Here’s how you can justify and explain the statement **"Debugged and optimized API integrations across multiple platforms, ensuring seamless data flow and minimal downtime"** in a way that aligns with your 1-year experience and the actual work you’ve done.

### Examples Anamoly detection in cloudwatch ###
Amazon CloudWatch Anomaly Detection can be applied to APIs, RDS, UI/CloudFront, and Cognito metrics to proactively detect irregularities. Here’s how you can implement anomaly detection for each:

---

### **1. APIs**
**Metrics to Monitor:**
   - Latency (`Latency` or `ResponseTime` metrics).
   - Error rates (`4xxError` and `5xxError`).
   - Request count (`Count`).

**Example: API Gateway Latency**
1. Open **CloudWatch Metrics**.
2. Navigate to the **API Gateway** namespace.
3. Select the `Latency` metric for a specific API.
4. Add anomaly detection:
   - Click **"Add anomaly detection band"**.
   - Adjust sensitivity to detect unusual latency spikes.
5. Set up an alarm:
   - Create an alarm to notify if the metric breaches the anomaly band.
6. Integrate with SNS for alerting or Lambda for auto-remediation (e.g., rolling back a deployment).

---

### **2. RDS (Relational Database Service)**
**Metrics to Monitor:**
   - CPU utilization (`CPUUtilization`).
   - Disk read/write IOPS (`ReadIOPS`, `WriteIOPS`).
   - Database connections (`DatabaseConnections`).
   - Free storage space (`FreeStorageSpace`).

**Example: Database Connections**
1. Open **CloudWatch Metrics**.
2. Navigate to the **RDS** namespace.
3. Select the `DatabaseConnections` metric.
4. Add anomaly detection:
   - Configure the band to account for regular peaks during business hours.
5. Set up an alarm:
   - Trigger an alert if connections exceed or drop below expected ranges.

---

### **3. UI / CloudFront**
**Metrics to Monitor:**
   - Cache hit rate (`CacheHitRate`).
   - HTTP 5xx and 4xx errors (`5xxErrorRate`, `4xxErrorRate`).
   - Latency (`OriginLatency` or `TotalTime`).

**Example: CloudFront Cache Hit Rate**
1. Open **CloudWatch Metrics**.
2. Navigate to the **CloudFront** namespace.
3. Select the `CacheHitRate` metric for your distribution.
4. Add anomaly detection:
   - Configure a narrow band to detect significant deviations in cache performance.
5. Set up an alarm:
   - Notify if the cache hit rate drops unexpectedly, indicating a potential misconfiguration or backend issue.

---

### **4. Cognito**
**Metrics to Monitor:**
   - Sign-in success rate (`SignInSuccess`).
   - Sign-in failure rate (`SignInFailure`).
   - Token refresh latency (`TokenRefreshLatency`).

**Example: Sign-In Failure Rate**
1. Open **CloudWatch Metrics**.
2. Navigate to the **Cognito** namespace.
3. Select the `SignInFailure` metric for your user pool.
4. Add anomaly detection:
   - Set a detection band with high sensitivity to catch even minor deviations.
5. Set up an alarm:
   - Trigger notifications for spikes, which could indicate a brute-force attack or misconfigured login.

---

### **5. General UI Metrics (Custom Metrics)**
For front-end applications, you can publish custom metrics to CloudWatch (e.g., page load time, error rates).

**Example: Page Load Time**
1. Use a monitoring tool (like Amazon CloudWatch SDK) to publish page load times as a custom metric.
2. Add anomaly detection:
   - Use the `CustomMetricName` in the **CustomNamespace**.
3. Set up alerts for deviations from expected page load times.

### **Interview Explanation Example:**
> "In my role, I worked on debugging and optimizing API integrations that connected various systems, ensuring that data flowed smoothly between platforms without disruptions. For example, we had API integrations between our web application and external services like **AWS Lambda** and **PostgreSQL**, which I helped monitor and troubleshoot. When issues like slow response times or data mismatches occurred, I used tools like **AWS CloudWatch** and **Postman** to identify root causes, optimize API calls, and improve overall performance. This helped reduce downtime and improved the reliability of our integrations, ensuring that the data flow remained seamless."

**"Designed and implemented SQL-driven monitoring scripts that identified and resolved 15+ critical data inconsistencies"** 

### **Interview Explanation Example:**
> "In my role, I designed and implemented **SQL-driven monitoring scripts** to automate the detection of data inconsistencies across our systems. For instance, I wrote SQL queries to validate data integrity between different sources, such as our **Postgres database** and external APIs. By setting up periodic checks, the scripts helped identify over 15 critical data inconsistencies, like mismatched records or missing data, that could have impacted downstream processes. I then worked with the team to resolve these issues by either updating the data or fixing the source of the discrepancies, ensuring the data flow remained accurate and reliable."

Here are a few example **SQL queries** that could be used to identify and resolve data inconsistencies in a database. These queries are simple, but effective for monitoring common data issues such as missing or inconsistent data:

### 1. **Identifying Missing or Null Values**
This query helps identify missing or `NULL` values in key columns, which could lead to inconsistencies in your data.

```sql
SELECT id, patient_name, diet_plan
FROM patients
WHERE diet_plan IS NULL OR patient_name IS NULL;
```

- **Purpose**: Identifies any records where the `diet_plan` or `patient_name` fields are missing, which could lead to incomplete or invalid data.

### 2. **Detecting Duplicate Records**
Duplicates in key columns (e.g., patient IDs or diet plan IDs) can cause inconsistencies in reporting or processing.

```sql
SELECT patient_id, COUNT(*)
FROM patient_diet_plans
GROUP BY patient_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

- **Purpose**: Identifies duplicate entries for the same patient in the `patient_diet_plans` table, helping to spot any redundancy or data integrity issues.

### 3. **Checking Referential Integrity**
If the database has foreign key relationships, you might want to check if all records in a child table have corresponding records in the parent table.

Query to Identify Orphaned Rows
sql

SELECT d.patient_id
FROM diet_plans d
LEFT JOIN patients p ON d.patient_id = p.patient_id
WHERE p.patient_id IS NULL;

Explanation:
LEFT JOIN:
Takes all rows from diet_plans and attempts to match each patient_id with a row in the patients table.
WHERE p.patient_id IS NULL:
Filters out rows where there is no matching patient_id in the patients table.
This query will return all patient_ids in diet_plans that do not have a corresponding record in patients. If this query returns any rows, it indicates a violation of referential integrity.

### 4. **Validating Data Ranges**
For numerical data like age, weight, or calorie intake, it’s essential to ensure that the data falls within an expected range.

```sql
SELECT patient_id, age
FROM patients
WHERE age < 0 OR age > 150;
```

- **Purpose**: Finds records where the `age` value is unrealistic, helping you detect data entry errors or inconsistencies.

### 5. **Identifying Data Mismatches Across Systems**
If you have multiple data sources (e.g., syncing patient data between a database and an external system), this query checks for discrepancies.

```sql
SELECT p.patient_id, p.diet_plan, e.external_diet_plan
FROM patients p
JOIN external_system_data e ON p.patient_id = e.patient_id
WHERE p.diet_plan != e.external_diet_plan;
```

- **Purpose**: Identifies mismatched diet plans between the internal database and an external system, which could indicate synchronization issues.

### 6. **Tracking Data Updates or Changes**
This query tracks when records were last updated, allowing you to identify if any important data hasn't been updated in a long time.

```sql
SELECT patient_id, last_updated
FROM patients
WHERE last_updated < NOW() - INTERVAL 30 DAY;
```

- **Purpose**: Identifies patients whose data hasn’t been updated in over 30 days, which could suggest outdated or stale information.

### 7. **Checking for Inconsistent Data Types**
This query checks for inconsistencies in data types, such as numeric fields containing non-numeric values.

```sql
SELECT patient_id, diet_plan_cost
FROM patients
WHERE diet_plan_cost NOT LIKE '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]{1,2})?$';
```

- **Purpose**: Identifies rows where `diet_plan_cost` is not a valid numeric value, which may indicate data corruption or entry errors.

### 8. **Data Consistency Check Across Tables**
If your system has data in multiple tables, this query helps ensure that related records match between tables.

```sql
SELECT p.patient_id, d.diet_plan_name, t.treatment_name
FROM patients p
JOIN diet_plans d ON p.diet_plan_id = d.diet_plan_id
JOIN treatments t ON p.treatment_id = t.treatment_id
WHERE d.diet_plan_name IS NULL OR t.treatment_name IS NULL;
```

- **Purpose**: Checks if there are any patients who are missing associated `diet_plan_name` or `treatment_name`, ensuring all required data is present.

### 9. **Date Consistency Between Tables**
In systems where dates are crucial, this query checks if the dates in different tables are aligned correctly.

```sql
SELECT p.patient_id, p.appointment_date, t.treatment_date
FROM patients p
JOIN treatments t ON p.patient_id = t.patient_id
WHERE p.appointment_date != t.treatment_date;
```

- **Purpose**: Finds patients whose `appointment_date` doesn't match their corresponding `treatment_date`, which could indicate scheduling or data entry errors.
