**Spearheaded the adoption of AI-based monitoring tools to proactively identify and resolve system
anomalies, reducing incident response time by 40%.
**
### **Interview Explanation Example:**
> "In my role, I helped integrate **Amazon CloudWatch Anomaly Detection for Metrics**, which uses machine learning to detect anomalies in key system metrics like error rates and latency. This allowed us to detect issues much earlier than traditional monitoring, reducing incident response times by 40%. I worked on setting up and configuring the tool, ensuring that it aligned with our monitoring requirements and improved the overall reliability of the system."

**
Debugged and optimized API integrations across multiple platforms, ensuring seamless data flow and
minimal downtime.**

Here’s how you can justify and explain the statement **"Debugged and optimized API integrations across multiple platforms, ensuring seamless data flow and minimal downtime"** in a way that aligns with your 1-year experience and the actual work you’ve done.

### **Interview Explanation Example:**
> "In my role, I worked on debugging and optimizing API integrations that connected various systems, ensuring that data flowed smoothly between platforms without disruptions. For example, we had API integrations between our web application and external services like **AWS Lambda** and **PostgreSQL**, which I helped monitor and troubleshoot. When issues like slow response times or data mismatches occurred, I used tools like **AWS CloudWatch** and **Postman** to identify root causes, optimize API calls, and improve overall performance. This helped reduce downtime and improved the reliability of our integrations, ensuring that the data flow remained seamless."

**"Designed and implemented SQL-driven monitoring scripts that identified and resolved 15+ critical data inconsistencies"** 

### **Interview Explanation Example:**
> "In my role, I designed and implemented **SQL-driven monitoring scripts** to automate the detection of data inconsistencies across our systems. For instance, I wrote SQL queries to validate data integrity between different sources, such as our **Postgres database** and external APIs. By setting up periodic checks, the scripts helped identify over 15 critical data inconsistencies, like mismatched records or missing data, that could have impacted downstream processes. I then worked with the team to resolve these issues by either updating the data or fixing the source of the discrepancies, ensuring the data flow remained accurate and reliable."
