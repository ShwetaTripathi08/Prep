**"Hi, this is Shweta, and I’m excited about the opportunity to speak with you today about the IT Product Support Analyst role at Flint Hills Resources.  

I have a Master’s degree in Computer Applications and a Master’s in Computer Science, along with 2 years of experience in technical support and software testing.  

Currently, I work at Numpy Ninja as a Senior SDET, specializing in monitoring and troubleshooting cloud-based applications deployed on AWS, as well as building automation testing frameworks using tools like Java, Python, and Selenium.  

Previously, I worked at All E Technologies, where I supported ASP.NET applications and focused on improving database efficiency.  

I really liked the job description as it matches well with my skill set. I’m confident that with my problem-solving abilities and curiosity to dive deep into issues, along with my experience in automation testing and debugging, I can be a valuable asset to the team"**
